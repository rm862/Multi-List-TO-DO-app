## Technical Details 

### Architecture
- **Single-file application** - All code in `to do.py` for simplicity
- **Object-oriented design** - `MultiListTodoApp` class encapsulates all functionality
- **Event-driven GUI** - Built on tkinter's event loop

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "current_list": "List Name",
  "task_lists": {
    "List Name": {
      "title": "Custom Title",
      "tasks": [
        {
          "text": "Task description",
          "completed": false,
          "created": "2025-10-02 14:30"
        }
      ],
      "created": "2025-10-02 14:00"
    }
  }
}
```

### Color Scheme
